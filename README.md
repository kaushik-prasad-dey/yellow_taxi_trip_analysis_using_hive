# Yellow taxi trip analysis using Hive
## Problem statement:
In this case study, we are giving a real world example of how to use HIVE on top of the HADOOP for different exploratory data analysis. In here, we have a predefined dataset (2018_Yellow_Taxi_Trip_Data.csv) having more than 15 columns and more than 100000 records in it. The dataset has different attributes like:

vendor_id string,

pickup_datetime string,

dropoff_datetime string,

passenger_count int,

trip_distance DECIMAL(9,6),

pickup_longitude DECIMAL(9,6),

pickup_latitude DECIMAL(9,6),

rate_code int,

store_and_fwd_flag string,

dropoff_longitude DECIMAL(9,6),

dropoff_latitude DECIMAL(9,6),

payment_type string,

fare_amount DECIMAL(9,6),

extra DECIMAL(9,6),

mta_tax DECIMAL(9,6),

tip_amount DECIMAL(9,6),

tolls_amount DECIMAL(9,6),

total_amount DECIMAL(9,6),

trip_time_in_secs int

### Perform taxi trip analysis by solving the questions below:

1. What is the total Number of trips ( equal to the number of rows)?

2. What is the total revenue generated by all the trips? The fare is stored in the column total_amount.

3. What fraction of the total is paid for tolls? The toll is stored in tolls_amount.

4. What fraction of it is driver tips? The tip is stored in tip_amount.

5. What is the average trip amount?

6. What is the average distance of the trips? Distance is stored in the column trip_distance.

7. How many different payment types are used?

8. For each payment type, display the following details:

    Average fare generated
    Average tip
    Average tax â€“ tax is stored in column mta_tax
9. On an average which hour of the day generates the highest revenue?
